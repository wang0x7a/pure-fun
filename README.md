Purely Functional Data Structures in OCaml
==========================================

This repor tracks my implementation of Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures in OCaml. 

I guarantee that the code will be written by myself, and I will refer to Markus Mottl's excellent example[1] to polish mine. Standing on the shoulders of giants. :-)
