Purely Functional Data Structures in OCaml
==========================================

This repo tracks my exercise solutions and OCaml implementation of the examples
in Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures[1]. 

I guarantee that the code will be written by myself, and I will refer to 
Markus Mottl's excellent examples[2] to polish mine. Standing on the shoulders 
of giants. :-)
